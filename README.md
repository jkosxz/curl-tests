# Curl Tests
## Overview
This repository contains a set of cURL requests that were tested using Postman to ensure the proper functionality of the CatAPI and GoalsAPI. The primary objective of these tests is to verify that the API is working as expected.

## Why CatAPI?
The CatAPI was chosen for testing due to its utilization of API key tokens. This feature adds an extra layer of security to the API, providing an opportunity to explore and practice working with secured APIs. By conducting tests on the CatAPI, users can gain valuable experience in handling authenticated requests and enhance their understanding of API security mechanisms.
